                            damage. A device or system with a fail-safe feature in the event of failure may revert to a
                            safe condition rather than break down, may include a secondary system that comes into
                            operation to prevent a malfunction, or may operate as a backup in the event of a
                            malfunction. A device or system with a fault-tolerant feature in the event of failure may
                            continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing

                            Term, the Software will be operational with a monthly uptime average of ninety-five percent
                            (95%), calculated based on an 8-hour day, during normal business hours, five (5) days per
                            week, excluding preventative and interim maintenance time (the “<strong><em>Uptime
                                    Warranty</em></strong>”). Licensee’s exclusive remedy and Licensor’s entire
                            obligation and liability for any breach of the Limited Warranty or the Uptime Warranty is to
                            repair or replace the Software or refund to Licensee the License Fee paid for the Software
                            if a repair or replacement of the Software would, in Licensor’s reasonable opinion, be
                            unreasonable. The Limited Warranty and the Uptime Warranty are conditioned upon Licensee
                            providing Licensor prompt written notice of the Software’s failure to perform substantially
                            in accordance with the Documentation or meet the required uptime average, as applicable.
